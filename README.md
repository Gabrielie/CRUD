#for This Assignmen. I create two object, posts and comments.
#The Variables that I was using are String, text, and integer.
#The comments belongs under each posts. and Posts can have many comments.
#I did CRUD to each objects.
#I've posted the project on github
#The default homepage was set up to show the list of posts
#Validations was added so users can not leave an empty post or comment.
#There were originall some of the tests created with the scaffold, I added two tests for the post and comment controllers, about the app should not save a comment without author's name and should not save a post without the title.
#I tried to include some Bootstrap, but when even I did it the whole application crush down, so I didn't use it in the version that I turned in.
